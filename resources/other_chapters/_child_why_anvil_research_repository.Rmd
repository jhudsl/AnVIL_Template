The AnVIL serves as a [cloud data repository compliant with the Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy](https://anvilproject.org/overview/dms-requirements). Data access controls can be specified to limit data access and use.

By submitting their data to AnVIL, not only can researchers meet the requirements of DMS Policy, they can also [contribute to the expanding network of NIH funded data housed in the AnVIL](https://terra.bio/anvil-platform-helps-meet-the-new-nih-data-management-and-sharing-policy-requirements/), furthering scientific discovery.

<details><summary>What is DMS Policy?</summary>

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Data Management and Sharing (DMS) policy requires that all NIH-supported research which generates [scientific data](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/how-will-this-policy-affect-me.html#scientific-data) (barring ethical, legal, or technical factors [limiting data sharing](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/how-will-this-policy-affect-me.html#when-to-not-share)) must create a plan and budget for data management and sharing.

While some funding announcements for some research may specify which repository should be used to comply with DMS policy, mostly the NIH does not specify [where data should be stored.](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/data-management-and-storage.html#data-repositories). The NIH does provide an [interactive table listing NIH supported data repositories](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/repositories-for-sharing-scientific-data) than can be used and [suggests that researchers use a repository most appropriate for the data generated from their research](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/selecting-a-data-repository).

<details><summary>How is data access managed and requests granted?</summary>

AnVIL utilizes the Data Use and Oversight System [(DUOS)](https://duos.org/) to efficiently expedite data access and management while maintaining security. Researchers can [explore datasets hosted in the AnVIL cloud and request access using DUOS](https://anvilproject.org/news/2024/11/15/duos-announcement). [Data use limitations can be set if necessary with Data Access Committees reviewing access requests](https://duos.org/anvil_dms_policy).
