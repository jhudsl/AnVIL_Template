1. If this member will need to add and remove other members of the Group, check the box for "Can manage members (admin)".  This will add them as an "Admin" for the Group.  Otherwise leave it unchecked, and they will be added as a "Member".
     - Admins and Members have equal access to any resources shared with the Group.
     - Admins can manage Group membership - they can add, remove, or change the role of other Group members.
