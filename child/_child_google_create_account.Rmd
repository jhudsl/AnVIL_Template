#### Choose Your Account Type

Do you plan to work with **controlled-access data** (e.g. GTEx, dbGaP)?

  - IF YES, **you MUST use an institutional email address**. To comply with NIH data security requirements, unaffiliated email accounts (such as gmail.com) CANNOT be given access to controlled-access data.

Will you be **moving between institutions**?

  - IF YES, you might consider a gmail account. There is no way to transfer a Terra account to a new Google account (e.g. a new institutional email). So, if you are *not* going to be working with Controlled-Access Data, it may be more convenient to use an unaffiliated gmail account.
:::

There are 2 ways to set up a Google account for use with Terra:

1. **Institutional Account**: use your institutional e-mail
    - If your institution uses G Suite, you can sign into Terra directly using your institutional Google account.
    - If your institution does not use G Suite, you can create a Google account that is associated with your non-Google institutional email address by following [these instructions](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029186611).
1. **Unaffiliated Google Account**: use a personal account
    - If you have an existing Google account (such as gmail.com), you can use it to sign into Terra.
    - If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, [create one now](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).
