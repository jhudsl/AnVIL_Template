# Overall Benefit: Ability to control costs

Cloud computing is not free and estimating costs may seem daunting to those considering use of the AnVIL. However, Terra provides thorough, transparent [documentation explaining data storage and cloud computing costs](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029748111-Overview-Controlling-Google-Cloud-costs-on-Terra) and has been working to improve transparency and management of costs for AnVIL users through [cost reporting, cost controls and estimates, and cost optimizations](https://terra.bio/tools-to-manage-terra-costs/). Additionally, in order to debug or benchmark your work, analyses or workflows can be tested with smaller scale test datasets or light environments without incurring much cost or spending a lot of time to configure environments.
