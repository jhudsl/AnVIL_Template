# Research Benefit: Create, share, and reuse reproducible analysis workspaces

[Workspaces can contain](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024743371-Working-with-workspaces) data, metadata, and analysis tools, as well as documentation and history of workflow runs, additionally displaying important information such as when the workspaces was created and last modified. Given all of this together with AnVIL being a web-based platform, workspaces can serve as a shareable, reproducible record of an analysis. AnVIL workspaces have previously been shared in publications to demonstrate reproducible science.

Examples include

Research conducted on the AnVIL platform has contributed to over 115 scientific publications citing the AnVIL paper, demonstrating its role in advancing genomic and biomedical research.
