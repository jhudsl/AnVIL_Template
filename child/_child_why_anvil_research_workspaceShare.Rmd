# Research Benefit: Create, share, and reuse reproducible analysis workspaces

[Workspaces can contain](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024743371-Working-with-workspaces) data, metadata, and analysis tools, as well as documentation and history of workflow runs, additionally displaying important information such as when the workspace was created and last modified. Given all of this together with AnVIL being a web-based platform, workspaces can serve as shareable, reproducible records of analyses. Research conducted on the AnVIL platform has contributed to over 115 scientific publications citing the AnVIL paper, demonstrating its role in advancing genomic and biomedical research.
