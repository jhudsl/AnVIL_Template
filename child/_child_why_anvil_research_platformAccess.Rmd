# Research Benefit: User-friendly process of accessing and interacting with the AnVIL platform

The primary means of accessing the AnVIL platform ([anvil.terra.bio](anvil.terra.bio)) is through a web browser - users do not need to download data or install software.

<details><summary>Accessing AnVIL beyond the web browser</summary>

The platform ([anvil.terra.bio](anvil.terra.bio)) provides a variety of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) as well as optional application programming interface (API) library/command line interfaces to interact with data, analysis solutions, and workflows. Bioconductor packages ([AnVIL](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/AnVIL/inst/doc/Introduction.html), [AnVILGCP](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnVILGCP.html), [AnVILWorkflow](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnVILWorkflow.html)) offer additional methods for users to programmatically interact with and access AnVIL resources from within AnVIL, or stand-alone computing environments such as a user's laptop.
