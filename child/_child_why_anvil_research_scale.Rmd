# Research Benefit: Scalability and flexibility in use

AnVIL is conducive to analysis at massive scale and for data exploration and training. Researchers get access to dedicated compute resources that might otherwise take time to queue for or don't exist at some institutions, and researchers can launch light environments or run test analyses without incurring much cost or spending a lot of time to configure.
