# Research Benefit: Ability to bring your own data or (with proper permissions) work with controlled access data

AnVIL securely stores diverse, open and controlled access, cloud-hosted datasets with a browsable summary catalog so researchers can identify relevant datasets they may need to request access to.

* [The 1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
* [The Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium](https://anvilproject.org/consortia/cser)
* [The Electronic and MEdical Records and Genomics project (eMERGE)](https://emerge-network.org/)
* [The Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology Consortium (PAGE)](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Population-Architecture-Using-Genomics-and-Epidemiology)
* [The Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC)](https://anvilproject.org/news/2021/03/11/hprc-on-anvil)
* [Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T)](https://anvilproject.org/news/2023/03/17/data-release-telomere-to-telomere)

[Additional consortia or upcoming planned data ingestion can be found on the AnVIL project portal](https://anvilproject.org/consortia). By inverting the typical method of genomic analysis, AnVIL brings a computing environment to the data rather than moving the data from storage to the computing environment or stories copies of the data across institutional high performance computing clusters.

<details><summary>Amount of data on AnVIL</summary>

As discussed in the [flagship AnVIL paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/), the AnVIL hosts data from >280,000 human genomes from >240 different cohorts spanning multiple consortia and major NHGRI projects. The AnVIL offers a browsable catalog of summary information about all of the datasets so that even if a user isn't authorized to access the data itself, they can better determine if the data will be helpful for their research if they need to apply for authorization for access. AnVIL is working to facilitate data harmonization across studies, ensuring consistency and interoperability, which is critical for large-scale analyses. These efforts will increase the value of the AnVIL data and maximize its utility to the researcher community.

<details><summary>AnVIL is a FedRAMP Moderate compliant platform</summary>

As a [FedRAMP Moderate compliant platform](https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5/baselines/), AnVIL maintains FedRAMP authorization of compliance to ensure as a cloud service provider, minimum security requirements are met for data processing, storage, and transmission of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) where loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effect or non-life threatening harm. All steps necessary to maintain compliance, such as robust logging of access to data, periodic audits by third-party analysts, and monitoring for abnormal use patterns are managed and guaranteed by AnVIL.
