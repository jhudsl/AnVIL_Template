# Overall Benefit: AnVIL is a collaborative community with a development mindset

AnVIL has begun hosting community conferences to collaboratively innovate during CoFests! and to discuss research performed with the platform as well as current development, feature request, and a roadmap or future directions for the platform.

Additionally, AnVIL values and routinely solicits user feedback to improve the user experience and provide the most beneficial features and enhancement for biomedical research. Feedback is gathered at the community conference, through [State of the AnVIL community polls](https://help.anvilproject.org/t/participate-in-the-state-of-the-anvil-2025-community-poll/275), and in voluntary user interviews.
