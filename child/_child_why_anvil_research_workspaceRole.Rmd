# Research Benefit: Group and workspace management structure for role-based permissions and collaboration

[Group management](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360022704371-Navigating-in-Terra) can be utilized to control who can access specific data, analysis workspaces, and your billing resources. [Workspaces provide a collaborative environment](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024743371-Working-with-workspaces) with role-based permissions. These [permission include reading, writing, or owning with additional permissions for running compute and sharing](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360025851892-Sharing-data-and-tools-with-workspace-access-controls). Especially within the contexts of working with sensitive data or large amounts of data. AnVIL's role-based group management permission structure is instrumental.
